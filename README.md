# India's Health Pulse: National Hospital Bed Infrastructure Digital Twin

**Live Demo:** [https://www.healthpulseindia.in](https://www.healthpulseindia.in)

### 1. Core Vision 🩺

> To architect an evidence-based digital twin of India’s hospital bed infrastructure, designed to combat data opacity by modelling a centralised, multi-stakeholder platform.

This project serves as the technical realisation of the framework proposed in **my preprint manuscript**, **"[Unlocking India's Hospital Beds: Why A Digital Portal Is the Cure for a Stretched System](https://preprints.jmir.org/preprint/84673)"**.

### 2. Key Architecture: The Dual-Loop Simulation Engine 🔄

The platform orchestrates two parallel **simulation loops** to decouple public information dissemination from internal operational dynamics.

* **The Deterministic Stream (Public Layer):**
    Powered by `helpers_public.ts` and the `GlobalContext`, this engine filters volatility to provide a **stable data feed**. It ensures citizens receive **actionable availability metrics** without the confusing noise of micro-fluctuations.

* **The Stochastic Stream (Strategic Layer):**
    Managed by `simulationEngine.ts` and the `StrategicContext`, this engine models **non-linear variables**—specifically staff fatigue and bed occupancy rates. It simulates health systems strain, where (e.g.) surging occupancy escalates emergency wait times.

> **State Synchronisation:** The system features **bi-directional data flow**. A manual override by a Nodal Officer in the **Hospital Portal** instantly propagates system-wide, demonstrating real-time responsiveness to human intervention.

### 3. Data Foundation 📊

Underpinning the platform is a **stratified pan-Indian dataset** of 150 hospitals, **manually curated** from **official hospital websites, government health bulletins, and public health directories** to ensure high fidelity.

### 6. Disclaimer ⚠️

This platform is a **proof-of-concept simulation** designed exclusively for **research and educational purposes**. While the underlying hospital dataset is real and verified, all live availability metrics are generated by **simulation engines** and **do not reflect real-world status**.

**Crucial:** This tool must **not** be used for medical emergencies or clinical decision-making.
