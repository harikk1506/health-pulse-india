# India's Health Pulse: A National Hospital Infrastructure Digital Twin

**Live Demo:** [https://www.healthpulseindia.in](https://www.healthpulseindia.in)

### 1. Core Vision 🩺

> To create a faithful, data-grounded digital twin of India’s hospital infrastructure to support data-informed decision-making for all citizens.

This project is the practical implementation of the theoretical framework proposed in the preprint manuscript, **"[Unlocking India's Hospital Beds: Why A Digital Portal Is the Cure for a Stretched System](https://preprints.jmir.org/preprint/84673)"**. It aims to solve the critical "information asymmetry" in India's healthcare system by creating a single, reliable source of truth for hospital capacity.

### 2. Key Architectural Feature: The Dual-Simulation Model

The application runs two parallel simulation loops to provide tailored data streams for different user groups, a key feature managed in `App.tsx`.

* **"Calm" Simulation (for Public/Emergency Portals):** A simplified engine in `helpers_public.ts` provides a stable data stream for a clear public-facing experience via the `GlobalContext`.

* **"Hyper-Dynamic" Simulation (for Hospital/Strategic Portals):** A more complex engine in `simulationEngine.ts` creates realistic feedback loops where high bed occupancy increases staff fatigue, which in turn increases patient wait times. This high-fidelity data is provided to internal portals via the `StrategicContext`.

Actions taken in one portal, such as a nodal officer overriding bed capacity in the `HospitalPortal`, have realistic, cascading effects throughout the entire digital twin.

### 3. Data Foundation 📊

The project is powered by a dataset of **150 hospitals** across India's five zones, contained in `src/data/hospitals.json`. This dataset was created through a rigorous, **28-hour manual process** of sourcing and cross-verifying data from official hospital websites, public health directories, and news articles to ensure high fidelity.

### 4. Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** React, Vite, TypeScript
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
* **State Management:** React Context API
* **Internationalization (i18n):** Support for English and Hindi.

### Disclaimer

This is a proof-of-concept simulation. While based on verified data, the live metrics are generated by a simulation engine and do not reflect real-time hospital bed status.
